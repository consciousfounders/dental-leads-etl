## Tips for Success

1. **Be specific but flexible** - List exactly what you want, but note you'll accept "to the extent available"

2. **Request electronic format** - Emphasize CSV/Excel to avoid getting paper printouts

3. **Mention commercial vs. non-commercial use** - Some states have different fee structures

4. **Ask about recurring access** - Some states offer subscription services for regular updates

5. **Follow up promptly** - If no response by the deadline, send a polite follow-up

6. **Appeal denials** - Most states have an appeal process; partial denials can often be challenged

7. **Keep records** - Document all communications for compliance and follow-up

---

## Alternative: Subscription Services

Some states offer paid subscription services that provide regular data updates:

- **Virginia Interactive** - $100 base + $20/1000 records
- **Arizona** - $100 for mailing list (digital)

These may be more cost-effective than repeated FOIA requests if you need ongoing updates.
